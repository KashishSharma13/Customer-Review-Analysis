# Customer-Review-Analysis
It is a Short ML project where reviews are analysed using Natural Language Processing Techniques.
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) linear Kernel classifier was used to predict customer review sentiment.    
Achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test dataset, indicating robust performance in classifying reviews as positive or negative.    
Implemented text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming, resulting in a cleaned corpus of 1,000 reviews ready for feature extraction using NLTK library for NLP.    
Developed using Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
